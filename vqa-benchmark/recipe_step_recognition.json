            "Leave the butter and chocolate to melt together, stirring now and then to encourage them along. Once you have a smooth, well-blended mixture, turn off the heat, lift the bowl off the pan (remember that it will be hot) and pour the mixture into a cold bowl or jug to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the batter",
            "Grease the insides of two small ramekins or pudding moulds with butter, put the cocoa in one, and turn and tip to coat the insides, holding it over the other ramekin to catch any powder. Tip the rest of the cocoa into the second ramekin and repeat",
            "Break the chocolate into fairly evenly sized pieces - I find the easiest and most satisfying way to start this process is to leave it in the packet, or put it in a resealable bag, give it a good whack against the work surface, then chop up any large pieces that remain. Cut the butter into chunky dice",
            "Put the egg and egg yolk in a large bowl with the sugar and a pinch of salt. Vigorously whisk by hand or with electric beaters, until the mixture is pale yellow and voluminous. Very gently fold in the melted chocolate mixture with a large metal spoon, taking care not to knock too much air out of the batter. Repeat with the flour",
            "Divide the batter between the two moulds, leaving a little room at the top for them to rise. If you'd like to eat them immediately, put them on the hot baking tray in the oven for 12 minutes, until the tops are set and the cake mix is just starting to come away from the sides of the moulds"
